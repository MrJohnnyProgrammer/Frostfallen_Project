<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> I take no credit for any visuals in the game, which includes meshes (both static and skeletal), VFX (as in niagara particles), and animations. In this project I take credit for the implementation of the aforementioned and every blueprint and C++ class asside from the engine's very own.
